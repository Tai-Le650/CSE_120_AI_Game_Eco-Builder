Gave each AI the same instructions.
"Create a web-based HTML game where the STEM topic is Ecology / Environmental Science. Have it where the player starts off with an environment and they can drag and drop different plants and animals. They can adjust the physical environment too, adding sand, rocks, trees, rivers, lakes, oceans, hills, and mountains. Each time the player adds or changes something it will show the effects of it in the game."
